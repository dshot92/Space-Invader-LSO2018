In a world, where dyslexia reigns
undisturbed through the population,
long distant neighbours in our
Milky Way Galaxy has had enough of it
and decided to get here and to give
us a new knowledge renaissance.
After some research they decide that
the most common way to contact us is
through landing in the United States.
Little did they know that the new
president of the USA is Donald J. Trump,
the sole reason of this dyslexia
spreading amongst human beings.

He immediately decide to counter this
new wave of knowledge with all the
military power he can muster.

So you find yourself trapped into
being a earth-trooper on the frontline
to defeat the knowledge of
the Alphabet Civilization.

Good Luck to you, trooper.

LONG LIVE DYSLEXIA
